Combine everything you've learned: loops, conditionals, and functions to navigate a complex maze to the goal.

Bonus: Complete in under 15 moves!

## Tip

Combine techniques: use functions for patterns, loops for repetition, and conditionals for decision-making.
Try creating a function that moves right if possible, otherwise moves down.

## Available Functions

robot.moveUp()
robot.moveDown()
robot.moveLeft()
robot.moveRight()
robot.canMove(direction)
robot.atGoal()

## Hints

1) Create a function that moves right if possible, otherwise moves down
2) Use a while loop to keep calling this function until you reach the goal
3) This combines functions, loops, and conditionals - you're becoming a programmer!
